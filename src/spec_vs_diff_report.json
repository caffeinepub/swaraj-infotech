  "summary": "Diff introduces a centralized Swaraj Infotech brand config and updates several UI entry points (BrandHeader, SplashScreen, Admin Login/Shell, HTML titles/icons) to reference Swaraj Infotech logos and text. However, the diff summary does not show the newly uploaded image files (1770580116347.png and 1770580116347-1.png) being added under frontend/public/assets/generated/, and it’s not possible from the provided diff summary to confirm a repo-wide removal of all remaining user-visible “Caffeine AI” references across the entire frontend.",
