  "summary": "Design a modern premium Android UI for the Swaraj Infotech app (dark theme, bright orange gradient accents, glassmorphism floating cards, rounded corners, soft shadows, clean typography, smooth animations, splash screen with centered logo + animated orange gradient ring), update all branding and logos to “Swaraj Infotech”, remove all Caffeine AI branding from the app, implement an OTP-based phone authentication flow (phone input → request OTP → enter/resend OTP → new-user profile creation) that routes to Home after login, and implement a Questions engine + Practice Mode (chapter selection, question list, question view with hint/answer/explanation, bookmarking, progress, offline cache) backed by questions and user-answer APIs, plus a Chapter Test flow (chapter selection → timed randomized test with mark-for-review → submit → results + review → history) backed by /test APIs, and add an Exam Mode with strict real-exam simulation for MSCIT (15 questions/15 min) and GCC-TBC (25 questions/25 min) including timer auto-submit, mark-for-review, no repeats within an attempt, results + weak chapters, and attempt history/review backed by /exam APIs. Additionally, build a separate standalone Admin Panel web dashboard with secure admin login (email/password, optional 2FA), role-based access (admin/moderator), full question/chapters/categories management (add/edit/delete/search/filter), bulk question upload via CSV with preview/validation and sample CSV template, users & results management (user list, test history, export CSV), in-app notifications composer, and backend backup/restore via JSON export/import with API endpoints for all admin operations. Also provide production-ready PostgreSQL DDL for documentation and mirror/emulate the same table-like schema inside the Motoko canister implementation, including Postgres-style middleware concepts (rate limiting and logging). Add viral & utility features: WhatsApp share with prefilled text + Play Store link, optional referral codes, push notifications for daily quiz reminders/new content, analytics dashboards (downloads/active users/retention), and an in-app feedback form to send to an admin email.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "OTP auth flow decisions: create profile only for new users after OTP verification; SMS stub endpoint always succeeds; post-login route goes to Home.",
    "Persist auth token locally after successful OTP verification.",
    "Backend profile fields required: user_id, name, phone, course, created_at (exam date optional per UI but not listed as required backend field).",
    "Define dashboard navigation map including bottom-nav routes (Home, Tests, Bookmarks, Profile) and card destinations (Practice Mode, Chapter Test, Exam Mode, Progress, Share App, Profile) with route params as needed (e.g., courseId).",
    "Questions domain model: questions(id, course, chapter, difficulty{easy,med,hard}, question, optionA, optionB, optionC, optionD, answer, hint, explanation, created_at).",
    "Questions API: GET /questions?course=&chapter=&limit=&offset= for paginated retrieval.",
    "User answers API: POST /user/answer to record answers for progress tracking (answered/wrong).",
    "Practice Mode should support local caching for offline access (cache questions per course/chapter; define invalidation/refresh strategy).",
    "UI behavior: show Hint text in smaller typography; show Explanation only after the user reveals/answers (post-answer).",
    "Chapter Test flow requirements: chapter selection → start test; defaults: 20 questions and 20-minute timer; randomize chapter-scoped questions with no repeats within the same test; support per-question 'mark for review'."
